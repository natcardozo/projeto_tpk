                <p>We are passionate designers, our goal is to create amazing 3D models for tabletop RPG games. We feel like crazy scientists in a laboratory, creating all sorts of monstrosities to release against unsuspecting adventurers.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitulo">We are a Lab</h2>
                <p>Rethink, redesign and recreate. These are the three words we keep in our minds when we are creating. We'll rethink creatures and make experiments. We'll look at the same old monsters in different angles and redesign them. We'll recreate an innocent creature into a deadly horror. 
                <p>We can fail, but we'll persevere. We are a Lab and our duty is to never stop trying to reach greatness, a deadly greatness. Help us, Join our Community.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitulo">Not all heroes grow old</h2>
                <p>All fantasy worlds have a thing in common, they are dangerous.</p>
                <p>With this in mind, we want to design miniatures of dead heroes. Each month we will release a "Glorious Death" miniature. Some of them can be "funny", other can be gore, but the main point is, not all heroes grow old.</p>
                <p>If you have ever thought about how great it would be to paint a dead character's model, Join our Community.</p>

                    <p>We are Modern Alchemists, we use the magic of the internet to deliver STL files for 3D printing. Be aware: We don't provide physical models. The download files of the collection may be a few GB large, so make sure you have enough storage space before starting the download. If you want to download now, Join Our Community.</p>

                    <p>We create our models thinking about the fun you'll have with your group of friends. It may be by playing Tabletop RPG games with our models or Painting them. Our main goal is to succeed in our Experiments and grow our lab. That's why we have some rules. Please don't share our files, cast our models or sell our printed miniatures. Our models cannot be used on Kickstartes, other Patreons or Boxes. Help us reach our goal, Join Our Community.</p>
